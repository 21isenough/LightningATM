# 3D Printed L-ATM Case PE-Edition

Below files can be used to print a case, which lowers your overall costs. The models can be printed  without any supports.

This is the first version and is designed to be used with inserts to mount the Coin-Acceptor as well as the Rasbperry-Pi Zero. For the Coin Acceptor use **M3** inserts [(Amazon)](https://amzn.to/35eNkgj), for the Raspberry-Pi **M2.5** [(Amazon)](https://amzn.to/2HjF0Uo) inserts are needed.
The Lids holds by friction fit.


For the case **needed** are 3 Parts: 
- **Shell**
  
- **Back Lid**
  - two versions
    - normal with 2mm thick plate
    - thicker with 3mm thick plate
- **Top Lid**
  - there are two separate versions:
    - with Lightning-Logo, *for dual color print add a **color change at Z 3.00 mm***. <img src="images/top_lid_with_logo.jpeg"  width="480">
    - without any logo
