I have added new 3D models, which can be supplemented with magnets so that you no longer have to attach the front panel to the case with a rubber band. You can find the procedure and more details in my Twitter Thread ...

Magnets: 5x5mm round nickel plate: https://www.supermagnete.ch/scheibenmagnete-neodym/scheibenmagnet-5mm-5mm_S-05-05-N
Metal plates: 2x10mm self-adhesive: https://www.supermagnete.ch/magnethaftgruende-selbstklebend/metallscheiben-selbstklebend-10mm_PAS-10
