## Would you like to help test the new version? üìñüßê

With this update comes a change of the GPIO inputs and outputs. This makes the inputs less sensitive to EMI interference that could lead to unwanted pulses. So if you had sporadic problems with your ATM, you should definitely try this update.

In addition, the function of a lockout relay for the coin acceptor was also implemented with the update. A useful function that one or the other has certainly wished for after the coin impulses were lost or the coin value was incorrectly recognized. A detailed documentation can be found in the new chapter [option: lockout relay](/docs/guide/relay.md).

Also coming with this update is the option to enable or disable a camera. This has the advantage that you don't have to edit the app.py file to get rid of the LNURL query display, if you don't have a camera or a button. The option to set different languages will be added later. The implementation will take place in the next update.

To participate, you must update your AMT software once with this new version. Don't worry, we have written a step-by-step instructions for this that really anyone can use and all your configuration data such as wallet and settings will be retained. You can easily undo the whole thing afterwards

### 1. Expand the config.ini

Because we are also expanding the config.ini with this update, we unfortunately have to expand config.ini manually, otherwise we get an error message when starting the ATM. Expanding is not difficult and does not have to be undone later. First we log in again via SSH and stop the LightningATM service and call up the config.ini.

    $ sudo systemctl stop LightningATM.service
    $ nano ~/.lightningATM/config.ini
    
Then we add the following text between `centname = cent` and `# Set the Fee in %`

    # Set language: "en", "de", "fr", "it", "es", "pt", "tr" currently available 
    # Code 2 from https://www.science.co.il/language/Codes.php
    language = en

    # Do you have a camera? "no" or "yes"
    camera = no

- When you finshed with changings in the config.ini, save and exit the editor: `CTRL+x -> y -> ENTER`
- `Help:` If you want to copy and paste the text, take the text to the clipboard and then place the cursor where you want to paste the text and right-click to paste. But important is just `language = en` and `camera = no`.

### 2. Update to the new version

Make a backup from directory LightningATM, clone the new Github to "temp", sync once from "temp" to "LightningAMT" and then delete the "temp" directory that is no longer needed.

    $ mv LightningATM LightningATM_Backup
    $ git clone --branch master https://github.com/21isenough/LightningATM.git temp
    $ rsync -a temp/ LightningATM/
    $ sudo rm -r temp
   
### 3. Start and test the version

    $ cd LightningATM
    $ ./app.py

- It takes a few seconds for the display to update, but then..
- The ATM has started and you can use it normally or test the functions.
- Stop the ATM with `CTRL+C`

### 4. If you don't like this version and want to get rid of it 

Make the backup the major version again and then delete the backup.

    $ cd
    $ rsync -a LightningATM_Backup/ LightningATM/
    $ sudo rm -r LightningATM_Backup

- Everthing should now be as befor. Even the wallat data.
- Check if you have set a temporary button and reset it with `payoutdelay = 12` in the `config.ini`

### 5. Final step

Restart the LightningATM service

    $ sudo systemctl start LightningATM.service

- Your ATM should now restart as usual
- If you find some issues or have some suggestions call @AxelHamburch in the telegram group or on Github
