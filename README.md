# LightningATM

This LightningATM was built to distribute small amounts of BTC - obviously - it only accepts coins. It shall demonstrate the power of Bitcoins Lightning Network. A two cent coin is enough to buy some satoshis at the LightningATM.

A physical coin exchanged into bitcoin and send to your lightning wallet in seconds. Use this project to educate your family and friends or guests at your bitcoin meetup - a convenient and easy on-boarding process for people that are new to bitcoin.

**Please be aware that this is a hobbyist project and it is not secure and reliable enough to withstand attacks. I discourage the use of this setup in a professional environment - but it's rather a good educational tool**

There are currently two versions of the Lightning ATM. The large full version with a camera for scanning invoices and a button for acknowledgment and other functions. And there is the somewhat slimmed-down version for mobile use, the pocket version.
