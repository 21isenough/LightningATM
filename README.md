# LightningATM

This LightningATM was built to distribute small amounts of BTC - obviously - it only accepts coins. It shall demonstrate the power of Bitcoins Lightning Network. A two cent coin is enough to buy some satoshis at the LightningATM.

A physical coin exchanged into bitcoin and send to your lightning wallet in seconds. Use this project to educate your family and friends or guests at your bitcoin meetup - a convenient and easy on-boarding process for people that are new to bitcoin.
